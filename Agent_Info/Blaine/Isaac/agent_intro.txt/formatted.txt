[2;37m[2;32mI clench my fists within the white and blue gloves tightly, my knuckles surely turning pale beneath the fabric… They say I have talents: combat, intelligence, reconnaissance, stealth. So why do they label it a mental disability, confining me alongside the rest?[0m[2;37m[0m[2;35m

What is glorious about the blood calling out to me? About my blood being spilt on the ground? I joined the Syndicate, thinking I could find solace, thinking I could fulfill some twisted destiny. Do what my father couldn’t. But the faces of those I’ve lost: the brother I can never bring back; the side of my father that won't- no, CAN'T ever return again will forever haunt me.

[2;37m[0m[2;35m[2;32mCason Blaine... my father. The beloved Captain. The hero. The man who turned his back on the Syndicate. His life painting the picture of betrayal; of watching innocence slip away. I can’t shake the image of him, standing there, helpless, watching the blood of his own flesh and blood pool in the darkness. And here I am... a product of that pain, drawn into the very depths of what he feared the most.

Before he can regain his footing, I unleash a rapid flurry of punches, each one landing with precision. The dim light barely illuminates his shocked expression as I drive my fists into his abdomen, then up to his jaw, the impact echoing in the silence.

I stand over him, breathing heavily, feeling the adrenaline coursing through my veins as the syndicate bomb materializes before me, glowing a beautiful red and black in the dim, blue alarm lights.

Images of those I care about flash through my mind, and I know, every time, that this is what I need to do to protect them all; to take up my father’s place. With a swift motion, I cut the wire as bullets tear through me.
